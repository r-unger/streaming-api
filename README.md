# Project streaming-api

This is a fully implemented example of a ReST API using Akka actor messaging in the backend.

Don't be confused by the name *streaming*, that is just the example functionality. The API can be accessed via
https://api.example.com/streaming-api-v1/serverspots, so the name of the project has to reflect that purpose.
